	custom elements gallery/software: https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/start/getting-the-code.html

Microformats:
	A "new standard" of html that hasnt been approved by W3C - can be activated via plugins
		Created to help bots, primarily (google)
	Not widely used (not universal by any means)

Semantic HTML
	HTML markup describes the meaning of the content, but not the appearance (what CSS does)...what about <h1>?
		When creating pages, choose the elements that best describe the meaning of your content without regard for their presentation

	<i> is now <emp> and <b> is now <strong>...why?
		allows CSS sheet to describe emphasis and strong displays (emphasis/strong = semantic, whereas italic/bold = stylistic)
		<i> = "read this text in alt voice"
		<b> = "read this text in a different mood"

	<div> and <span> can be assigned "classes" or "IDs" for identification/relationship identificiation

		!!! ID IS ONLY FOR USE IN ONE-OFF CIRCUMSTANCES !!!
			<div class="products">
				<span class="name">

			<div class=:"users">
				<span class="name">

Exploring & Debugging:
	"http is for everyone" - html/javascript/css 
	are publicily accessible for all websites
	Chrome Deb Tools - make edits and see live (refresh will reset)
	CodePen.io - html/css "scratchpad" (can be saved)

	!!! ALWAYS VALIDATE CODE VIA W3C SITE (OR OTHER)!!!

IECCs:
	Getting IE8 to understand HTML5:
	This "comment" is recognized by IE ONLY as a marker:
		<!--[if lt IE 9]>
		<script src="//html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
		<![endif]-->

Nsting HTML:
	each element must be properly nested 
	(fully contained within parent element)

Generic containers:
	<div id="main">
		<p><span>Content</span>goes here</p>
	</div>

	<div></div>
		logicial division of a page: banner, nav bar, sidebar, etc
			inlcude a line break
	<span></span> 
		individual words and phrases (inline elements) within paragraphs
			do not include a line break
	More Containers:
	<header></header>
	<footer></footer>
	<article></article>
	<section></section>
	<h1..h6></h1..h6>

	see: http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.png

Buttons
	<input type="button" value="submit">
	<button type="button" value="submit"

Input
	<input type="text" name="lastname">
	Specifies user input field, doesn't do anything on its own (must be passed to method via form)

Anchor Tag
	<a></a>
	links multiple pages; make the web "the web"

Images:
	<img src="images.jpg" alt="Alt text" />
	Note: alt value is require
		self-closing (void) tags --> there aren't many, but don't require a closing tag (also can't take anything other than source and options [no text])

Comments:
	framed by <!-- comment text -->
		not frequently used...will not display on output but will be included in source code

Character Escapes:
	framed by & and ; (eg D&#237;blahblah)
		while in "escape mode", #treats remaining characters as numeric code
	for "&" in text, put &&

Standard Syntax:
	<a href="web.com">Wyncode</a>
		1. element/tag <a></a>
		2. attribute (href = web.com)
		3. values (Wyncode)
		
Boilerplate: standardized pieces of text
	HTML Boilerplate:
		<!DOCTYPE html> #=> what version of html to expect
		<html>
			<head>
				<meta charset="utf-8" /> #=> ASCII or UTF-8 (non-specified = comp guesses = potential security risk)
				<title></title> #=> text in browser tabs/bookmarks (required)
			</head>
			<body> #=> rest of code here
			</body>
		</html>
